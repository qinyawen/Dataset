# Dataset

We create datasets for scene classification and continuous authentication separately. For scene classification task, our experiment includes five scenarios: static sitting, dynamic sitting, lying, walking, and jogging. The sensor data frequency is 50Hz, with a sample duration of 50 seconds. The entire dataset contains 30,000 samples, with an equal distribution of scenes (1:1:1:1:1). The dataset is randomly split into training, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio. For the continuous authentication task, 25 users participated in data collection, including 12 males and 13 females. The age structure is divided into three groups, (1:1:1). Moreover, each participant's data is processed individually to create a dataset. The positive and negative samples are balanced in a 1:1 ratio, with negative samples randomly selected from the data of other participants in the same scenario. Each user has approximately 600 samples per scenario. The dataset for each user is randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio, and frequency of sensor data is also 50Hz, with a sample duration of 50 seconds.
